## IMDb API Fetcher

This project fetches **all episodes, directors, and TV shows** from the [IMDb API](https://api.imdbapi.dev) and saves the results locally in JSON format.  

### Features

- Supports fetching:
  - ðŸŽ¬ Episodes (with season, episode number, runtime, ratings, etc.)  
  - ðŸŽ¥ Directors  
  - ðŸ“º TV Shows  
- Saves results to easy-to-read JSON files with proper indentation.  

### Example Usage

from imdb_fetcher import fetch_all_episodes

# Replace with a valid IMDb show ID
episodes = fetch_all_episodes("tt2861424")  
print(f"Fetched {len(episodes)} episodes")
